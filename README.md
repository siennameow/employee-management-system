# Employee Management System

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/siennameow/note-taker/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Description 📝 

The Employee Management System is a Command-line interface based application written in Javascript utilizing node, inquirer and mySQL on the backend to provide the user with a large array of possible functions. The mySQL database schema has a table for departments, roles, and employees that allow for the user to manipulate the data within each table in several ways.

Users are able to :
- add, view or delete...
  - employees
  - departments
  - roles
- view employee based on common manager's
- view how much each department is utilizing on salary
- update who is set as the manager of an employee
- update an employee's current role

## Code Snippet 💻

JavaScript

Function to query database and allow user to view the total utilized budget of a department

```JavaScript
function budgetUtilized (){
db.query (
  `SELECT DISTINCT name from department`, (err,result) =>{
  if (err) throw err;
  inquirer.prompt({
        name: "department",
        type: "list",
        message: "Which department would you like to view?",
        choices: () =>
        result.map((result) => result.name),
        })
        .then ((answer) => {
          db.query (
          `SELECT name AS department, SUM(salary) AS utilized_budget
          FROM employee
          LEFT JOIN role
          ON employee.role_id = role.id
          LEFT JOIN department
          ON role.department_id = department.id
          WHERE name = "${answer.department}"
          GROUP BY name`, (err,finalResult) =>{
            if (err) throw err;
            console.table("The combined salaries of all employees in " + answer.department + " department is:", finalResult);
            initPrompt();
        })
  })
})
}
```

Function to prompt user and lelete roles from database

```JavaScript
function deleteRole () {
  db.query("SELECT DISTINCT title FROM role", (err, result) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    inquirer.prompt({
        name: "title",
        type: "list",
        message: "Which role would you like to delete?",
        choices: () => 
          result.map((result) => result.title)
      })
      .then ((answer) => {
      db.query(`SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;
      DELETE FROM role WHERE ?`, {title: answer.title},
          (err, result) => {
              if (err) throw err;
              console.log(
                "Successfully deleted the " + answer.title + " role."
              );
              initPrompt();
          });
      })
  })
}
```

## Installation 🗳 

After downloading the repository, run `npm i` to install several dependencies for the package. 

Besides that, either from the command line or from mySQL Workbench, use the `schema.sql` file to generate the appropriate schema for your database and `seeds.sql` to import dummy data to get started. If you choose not to use the dummy data, I recommend first creating the departments, then the roles within each departments, and then the employees.

## Usage 💡

After installation :

1. Either from the command line or from mySQL Workbench, run `schema.sql` file to generate the appropriate schema for your database and `seeds.sql` to import dummy data to get started.
2. Run `node index.js` to start
3. Follow through the prompts as required
